# TELL, DON'T ASK (https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html)

> Procedural code gets information then makes decisions. Object-oriented code tells objects to do things. (Alec Sharp)

> Tell-Don't-Ask is a principle that helps people remember that object-orientation is about bundling data with the functions that operate on that data. It reminds us that rather than asking an object for data and acting on that data, we should instead tell an object what to do. This encourages to move behavior into an object to go with the data. (Martin Fowler)
